            <h1>Biases and human decisions</h1>
            <p>
                As a student in informatics at the dawn of the digital age,  <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" a href=> machine learning (ML)</a>  /  <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" a href=>artificial intelligence (AI)</a> is of special importance today. As it is carried out by people with computer background,
                 but I would claim that the importance of AI and machine learning is important for about all fields today due to its widespread <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://connect.comptia.org/blog/artificial-intelligence-statistics-facts" target="_blank" a href=>use (link to statistics)</a>
                 . It is the next step of automatization, where all kinds of patterns are recognized by new levels of efficiency which enter many human fields, the aim of this article is to lift up some of tensions 
                 between ML/AI and biases towards sensitive categories like ethnicity, socio-economical levels and gender. And how ML/AI decisions is very hard to legitimate ad hoc. 
             <br>
                ML/AI efficiency comes at several prices which may alter and / or disguise societal values. First is that machine learning and artificial intelligence needs to be trained, by old patterns and earlier actions made
                 upon them. Which causes whatever of biases already built into that training data to be learned as well, then it's somehow ‘washed’ by seemingly objective computers. Even if you remove political and cultural
                  historical problematic categories like ethnicity, background variables will push them forward as there just a part of the of bigger puzzle on how humans have divided the world analytically and also have they have been taking actions on it.
                  And where humans have been taught and prohibited by laws from using such categories, a computer may do exactly that to be regarded as 'efficient'. The artifical intelligence does its job, but its allready a part of
                  a bigger system, a system with a history and interwoven with society on many levels. An example of this issue was seen when Microsoft chatbot "Tay" was trained by humans, and went from humans are cool - to a right wing super fascist in less than 24h with training.
                  Thus the latest AI libaries like GDP3 are restricted usage to be fascilitated by humans now. And even if recent art generated by AI reach new levels, its not very suitable for children as its very hard to ethcically restrict.

                Another issue is to follow why those actions made, or what kind of patterns were created to make “the optimal” action. As one of the reasons why modern computers manage to create this new highly advanced patters,
                 is that it can be millions of subclasses of previous data which cause the action to be put forward. For a human in a court of law, it doesn’t necessarily make sense. And may also be an advance way to wash and
                  make historical biases more permanent. Like biases towards ethnicity, sex, or social political backgrounds. 
             <br>   
              
                  We don’t think this will be approved upon in many fields as won’t have the legitimacy as human
                   professions have traditionally, while it might be more likely to be carried out in under traditional professions and under private enterprises. There will be a regulations and laws which tries to open
                    more possible insight and reduce biases. But exactly how especially this ability to show why some action was made, is now hard to say. And might cause a lot of actions to not be automated to keep their
                     legitimacy. While on the other hand, the traditional human made choices might come under more siege. Especially by parts of society already trained in technology, where determinism is a bigger factor
                      in a knowledge world based more upon what programmable. Why a human made decision is better, could be in those eyes be looked upon as more ad hoc explanation along politically correct lines. While the
                       claim would be that the action “in reality” was another, and less precise than a advance machine would have done it but along the same lines anyhow.
